I'll start off with the customary&ndash;I'm a huge fan. Also, sorry for missing your birthday. I'm sure you had fun.

In a couple years, my class is having this little party. We'd like you to come. Of course, we'll provide your travel, a couch (or bed/hotel if you prefer), some food, and loads of southern hospitality. 

I'm really tired. So, I'll stop for now. But just think about it.
