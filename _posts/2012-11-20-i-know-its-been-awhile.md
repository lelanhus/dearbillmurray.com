I know; it's been awhile. There's no excuse. I was travelling&hellip;school&hellip;life.

Meh. Who are we kidding?

We know what's responsible. And we're not going to take it. Those things&hellip;

Ahh, yes. I hear you met our class president at a baseketball game. I never played basketball much. People used to always ask, "Do you play basket ball?" 

Then I would look them in the eye, muster up the saddest, most puppy-dog-looking eyes, just holding back the tears and reply, "No, why do you ask?" (I'm 6'5".)

Height doesn't automatically makes you a basketball player. It does, however, guarantee that one is uncomfortable on every form of public transportation, including air travel. Do you know how hard it is to sit in a coach seat for 15 hours? Probably not, but I understand. I could've upgraded, but I wanted to save the miles. I don't know why.
