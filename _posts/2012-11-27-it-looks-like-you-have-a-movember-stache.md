title: It looks like you have a Movember `stache.
---

A classmate posted a picture of you and him. It's blurry, but looks like you're sporting a mighty fashionable mustache. If you were on a horse, you'd be set if there were a third Boer war. I really shouldn't make fun. When I try to grow a beard or mustache, it looks like a ten year old that played with a broken Etch A Sketch. 

My class has a fundraiser for [Movember](http://us.movember.com/team/747989). There's also bake sales and stuff. The girls wear fake mustaches for the bake sale. All I have is an Etch A Sketch&hellip;
