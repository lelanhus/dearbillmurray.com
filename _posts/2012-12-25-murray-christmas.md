title: Murray Christmas.

Apparently your name demands a pun for Christmas. I will not say "Murray Christmas." I will say "Merry Christmas" or whatever sentiment won't offend you. 

Oscar Wilde thought puns were the height of humor; they're not. Puns do not make me laugh. Statements like "pun intended" or "pun not intended" don't make me laugh; they fill me with disdain for perpetrating liar.

Authoring the pun ensures the author intended the pun. Therefore, the author either feels the need to state the obvious or must lie to the audience. We do not need liars.

When you visit, please avoid puns. But then again, it's easy to be a holy man on top of a mountain.
