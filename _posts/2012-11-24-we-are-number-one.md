Mississippi gets a bad rap. Sure, we're dead last in math and science education. Parts of the state aren't much different from a third-world country. We have the lowest median income in the whole of the United States. We also have the lowest number of physicians per capita.

But everyone forgets, we're number one in teen pregnancy.
