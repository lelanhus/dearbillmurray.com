title: Holy crap. You're a superhero too?
---

You know, you make it hard for a regular guy. You're funny. You knew other funny people. You're probably well traveled. But to top it all off, you're a [superhero](http://theprevailingethos.com/2013/01/29/bill-murray-catches-bank-robber-in-tokyo/) too?

You'll love Jackson then. We've got loads of [crime](http://spotcrime.com/ms/jackson).
