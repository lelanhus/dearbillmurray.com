title: You have your own subreddit.

Did you know you have your own subreddit? You do. Click the [link](http://www.reddit.com/r/billmurray).

If it makes you feel better, I don't have my own subreddit. We can post pictures of your visit to your subreddit. We'll even use Imgur if you want. 

One thing is non-negotiable. We'll go to Two Sisters. Why?

[Fried chicken](http://www.foodandwine.com/slideshows/best-fried-chicken-in-the-us/3), that's why.
