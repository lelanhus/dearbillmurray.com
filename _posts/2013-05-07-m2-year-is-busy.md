title: I'm not as smart as you.

Sorry for not writing more frequently. I hope to do better during M3 year. M2 year is just really busy.

We're in dedicated study now for our first licensing exam. It's called Step 1, and it's supposedly the single most important test in your medical career. See, the test is a benchmark for comparing all medical students. The higher the score, the smarter people think you are, which usually translates to a more competitive specialty. More competitive specialties tend to pay more too. But that's a dangerous road. 

No matter how smart or not-so-smart I appear on a standardized basic science exam, I'll never be as smart as you at comedy. Perhaps, you'll give us a lesson or two when you come to visit.
